#### I explore another framework for styling, which is <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/tailwindcss/tailwindcss-original.svg" width="30" height="30"/>Tailwind CSS

#### I practice the syntax and create a simple ui with smooth transition 
#### The benefits for using this framework are that the development is much more faster than using traditional CSS
#### The downsides are the readability of the code in HTML because all the styling is inline. The good thing is that I won't have any problems with specificity.
